This Page is rather weird, here I simply put the stuff that I use on my Computer so you can maybe learn about new software and other things and so that I can in the future see what I have used. Of course, I am not gonna mention all things but the more obscure and less obvious things will find their place here.

## Applications

Github Desktop

## Extensions

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| [Vimium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb) | With this awesome browser extension you can navigate web pages without ever touching the mouse. |
| [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com/) | I use grammarly to write my articles so I am happy that there are extensions available for different places most notably [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=znck.grammarly) and for the Desktop. |
| [Github Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) | I got it too alright, and I'm not talking about a crush on typescript. At first I thought copilots hype was rather excessive, but then when I tried it it blew me away. |
| Markdown all in One | You dont need this extension you want it. |

Also for the ones interested I use *Dark+ V2* Theme in VS Code.
