I'm in love! there I said it and im not embarrased whatsoever. Svelte is awesome, its intuitive, fast and it has all the things I want. Thats why today we are gonna build a carousel component with it. We'll look at the `scroll-snap` property in CSS and how we can make a our component themable via CSS variables.

[Demo](https://demos.maximmaeder.com/d/carousel-component-with-svelte/index.html).

Let's get right into it.

## Carousel Component Markup

Let us first go over the markup of the Carousel Component

The Markup consist of a div with a class called container which we'll later use to align the left and right button and the actual content on one horizontal axis via flex box. Inside the container we have two buttons one for scrolling left and one for scrolling right. We also have a div with a class called items-container which will hold all the items we want to scroll through. Inside the items-container we have a slot with no name so all passed elements with no slot property will be put there. Within the button we all have named slots so another developer can easily change the buttons without having to edit the component it self.

```svelte
<div class="container">
    <button on:pointerdown={left} style="opacity: {scroll_left == 0 ? '0' : '1'}">
        <slot name="left_button">&lt;</slot>
    </button>
    <div
        class="items-container"
        bind:clientWidth={current_width}
        bind:this={container}
        on:scroll={scroll}>
        <slot></slot>
    </div>
    <button on:pointerdown={right} style="opacity: { (Math.abs((scroll_left + current_width) - scroll_width) < 3) ? '0' : '1' }">
        <slot name="right_button">&gt;</slot>
    </button>
</div>
```

As you see we also set the opacity of the buttons depending on wether the scroll container has been scrolled all to the left or right. For this we need to get the `scroll_left` property of the element its width and scroll width (The full width of the element that may be hidden with a scroll bar).

Sadly we cant bind the `scroll_left` and `scroll_width` properties to the container element, so we have to create a function which will get that for us via a dom binding that is done with the `bind:this` attribute.

## Carousel Component JavaScript

Next up in the JavaScript or better said the TypeScript of our program we dont do much. We just create the variables we need and the functions to scroll left and right. We also create a function to get the scroll left and scroll width of the container element.

These values and functions are set and called within the markup of the component.

Mind the `scrolBy` function tha as it's name suggests allows us to scroll an overflowing element however we want.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
    let current_width = 0;
    let container : HTMLElement;

    let scroll_left = 0
    let scroll_width = 0

    function left() {
        container.scrollBy(-current_width, 0)
    }
    function right() {
        container.scrollBy(current_width, 0)
    }
    function scroll() {
        scroll_left = container.scrollLeft; 
        scroll_width = container.scrollWidth;
    }
</script>
```

## Carousel Component CSS

I also have another mistress her name is tailwind, often times when I spend time with my girlfriend CSS I say stuff like `flex-col` instead of `flex-direction: column`. No but really I have used so much tailwind It's almost painful going back to regular CSS, but lets try it anyway ðŸ˜€. Also it's alway good to know and have a deep understanding of the basics / the underlying features.

So let's also look at the CSS.

As you see for the buttons and some other properties we use CSS variables. This allows us to theme the component without having to edit the component itself. We can just change the CSS variables and the component will look different. Actually its also possible to pass a css variable as a prop in svelte.

```svelte
<style>
    .container {
        display: flex;
        overflow: hidden;
        gap: var(--cr-container-gap, 0.5rem);
        justify-content: space-between;
        width: 100%;
    }

    button {
        color: var(--cr-button-color, #000);
        background-color: var(--cr-button-bg-color, white);
        border-color: var(--cr-button-border-color, white);
        border-width: var(--cr-button-border-width, 1px);
        border-radius: var(--cr-button-border-radius, 0.25rem);
        border-style: var(--cr-button-border-style, none);
        padding: var(--cr-button-padding, 1rem);
    }

    .items-container {
        display: flex;
        flex-grow: 1;
        overflow: auto;

        overflow-x: auto;
        scroll-snap-type: x mandatory;

        scroll-behavior: var(--cr-scroll-behavior, smooth);
        -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;
    }

    :global(.items-container > *) {
        scroll-snap-align: start;
        flex-shrink: 0;
    } 
    
    .items-container::-webkit-scrollbar {
        display: none;
    }
</style>
```

Also mind the `scroll-snap-type: x mandatory;` property. This is the property that allows us to snap to the next element when scrolling. This is the property that makes the carousel work.

Ssince Svelte styles are scoped to just this component we have to use the `:global()` selector to select the children of the items-container.

## Carousel in action

Now let's see how we can use the carousel component. For this example I have used [fakerjs](https://fakerjs.dev/guide/).

```svelte
<Carousel>
  {#each Array(10) as _, i}
    <div style="width: 100%">
      <img src={faker.image.avatar() } alt="" width="50">
      <h2>{ faker.person.fullName() }</h2>
      <p>{faker.lorem.paragraph()}</p>
      <p>@{ faker.company.name() }</p>
    </div>
  {/each}
</Carousel>
```

We can also apply our own styles to the component.

```svelte
<div class="custom_carousel">
  <Carousel --cr-button-bg-color="hsl(0 0% 95%)">
    {#each Array(10) as _, i}
      <div style="" class="item">
        <img src={faker.image.avatar() } alt="" width="100" style="flex-shrink: 0">
        <div>
          <h2>{ faker.person.fullName() }</h2>
          <p>{faker.lorem.paragraph()}</p>
          <p>@{ faker.company.name() }</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    {/each}
  </Carousel>
</div>

<style>

  * {
    box-sizing: border-box;
  }

  .item {
    font-family: monospace;
    width: 100%;
    display: flex;
    gap: 2rem;
    align-items: center;
    padding-inline: 4rem;
  }

  .custom_carousel {
    max-width: 1000px;
    margin: 0 auto;
  }
</style>
```

So thats it, I hope you had a good time and that you learned something new! Svelte is really worth checking out and I hope you will give it a try. If you have any questions or suggestions feel free to [contact](https://maximmaeder.com/contact/) me.
