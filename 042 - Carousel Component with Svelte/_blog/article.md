I'm in love! there I said it and im not embarrased whatsoever. Svelte is awesome, its intuitive, fast and it has all the things I want. Thats why today we are gonna build a carousel component with it. We'll look at the `scroll-snap` property in CSS and how we can make a our component themable via CSS variables.

[Demo](https://demos.maximmaeder.com/d/carousel-component-with-svelte/index.html).

Let's get right into it.

## Carousel Component Markup

## Carousel Component JavaScript

## Carousel Component CSS

I also have another mistress her name is tailwind, often times when I spend time with my girlfriend CSS I say stuff like `flex-col` instead of `flex-direction: column`. No but really I have used so much tailwind It's almost painful going back to regular CSS, but lets try it anyway ðŸ˜€. Also it's alway good to know and have a deep understanding of the basics / the underlying features.
