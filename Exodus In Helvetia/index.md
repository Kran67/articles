## Characters

### Maxim Maeder

Because his father fell in the Helvetian Civil War he was brought up by his deaf mother. this is how he learned sign language which he still uses today even though he knows no one who speaks it.

He was part of the Maeder-Bachmeier Bande that he co-founded. After its dissolution, Maxim went into hiding to raise a child that was part of the gang.

In 2012 he had to resurface after someone blackmails him into killing the Mob Boss Angelo Merte.

He's an old-school kind of guy but he understands that some of the things today are good and useful.


### Friedrich Zollenhoffer

Mob Boss in ULG lives after an old code and respect people like Maxim Maeder for that.

### Angelo Merte

Mob Boss in Helvetia has a deadly rivalry with Friedrich Zollenhoffer after he killed his best friend and Wive in 1998

### Linuks Langenberg

After his brother was killed by Members of the Angelo Merte Organisation in 1997 he entered service as a secret drug enforcement agent.

Linuks would 2012 work with known criminals which made him a rogue agent.


### Maria Bachmeier

in 1981 she killed the Murderer of her seven-year-old daughter in open court. After several years in prison, she became a petty thief until she met Maxim Maeder.

This is when they founded the *"Maeder-Bachmeier Bande"*. The Gang operated until 1999 when it was defunct because of heightened Police attention after the *Great Forest Fire*.

It is unclear whether she is still alive (2012).
