Its finally here: [Godot 4.0](https://godotengine.org/article/godot-4-0-sets-sail/) just released and I want to celebrate that by diving back into this awesome game engine and making a text file editor with it.

Bear in mind that I wont go over everything that this project includes, I will only go over the scene tree and the code. If you want you can head over to my [articles repository](https://github.com/Maximinodotpy/articles) and download the project to see for yourself.
