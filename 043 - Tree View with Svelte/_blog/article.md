Welcome to another Svelte Tutorial; this time, we will build an interactive Tree View with Svelte. File Explorers or UI elements of similar nature often use Tree Views; therefore, they are very good at showing that one item is "part" of another.

We'll make the Component as flexible as possible. It will only render a json tree object with a bunch of `detail` elements and nothing more, but we make it so we can pass a slot into this Component which will take over rendering the Items themselves. 

For this to work, we must learn about slots, props, and recursive components. Don't be afraid. Like everything else in Svelte, this is easy and intuitive.

## Tree View Component

Let's dive straight into creating the Component Code.

Right at the start, we have some code that may be new for some folks. In Svelte, we can add two types of script Blocks to a file, and here we use the `module` type, which we indicate by setting the context attribute to module. Within this block, we define the types and interfaces the Component needs; in this case, it's a tree item and a list of tree data. Items must have a `name` attribute and can have a `children` feature, which has more items as a list, and further, optionally, it can have any key it wants. No other files can import these types.

```svelte
<script context="module" lang="ts">
    export interface TreeItem {
        name: string;
        children?: TreeItem[];

        // To allow custom keys
        [key: string]: any;
    }

    export type TreeData = TreeItem[];
</script>
```

Next up, we reach the actual and standard script block. Thankfully it is not too complicated. We must export a variable to pass it in as a prop representing the tree data. We also create a function that will be called on the `keyup` event that checks whether the space key was pressed in an element within the summary tag. We need to do this because we will later add inputs to the view, and when the user presses spaces, it will toggle the folding of the details element, and we don't want that.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
    export let tree_data: TreeData = [];

    function summaryKeyup(event: KeyboardEvent) {
        if (event.key ==  ' ' && document.activeElement.tagName != 'SUMMARY') {
            event.preventDefault();
        }
    }
</script>
```

Now we'll come around to the Markup, which consists of a `ul` filled with each element of the tree data list within `li` elements. We also get the index by appending `, i' after the iterator name. As you see, we check whether the current item has children, which will determine whether it gets a details element or not. If it doesn't, we insert a slot pass in the item with a `list` and `id` attribute. Later when we use the Component, we see how to receive these slot props.

```svelte
<ul>
    {#each tree_data as item, i}
        <li>
            {#if item.children}
                <!-- Code For "Folder" Element -->
            {:else}
                <slot {item} list={tree_data} id={i}>
                    {item.name}
                </slot>
            {/if}
        </li>
    {/each}
</ul>
```

Next, let's look at how an element with Children is handled. We use the `details` HTML element, an accordion for free. We put the always visible text within the `summary` element; here, we again use a slot element. After that, we add the special `svelte:self` element, enabling us to use this element within itself recursively. Here we need to pass in the data we also have to pass in from the outside, and we also connect the slot props.

```svelte
<details>
    <summary class="flex" on:keyup={summaryKeyup} role="button" tabindex="0">
        <slot {item} list={tree_data} id={i}>
            {item.name}
        </slot>
    </summary>

    {#if item.children}
        <div class="pl-8">
            <svelte:self tree_data={item.children} let:item let:list={tree_data} let:id={i}>
                <slot {item} list={tree_data} id={i}>{ item.name }</slot>
            </svelte:self>
        </div>
    {/if}
</details>
```

## Using the Component

Well, that was a lot, but I hope you understood how to create a recursive Tree Component with Svelte. Let's also go over some ways of using this Component.

### Raw Tree View

The Raw view is easy to use. You must pass an object the tree_data property that conforms with the `TreeData` type.

```svelte
<TreeView tree_data={tree_data} />
```

This is alright, but we can do this better by styling the items ourselves.

### Styled Tree View

To style our Tree View, we pass an HTML Element to the Tree View, which will be rendered for every element no matter how nested it is. We also need to get the item variable/prop to use it for our Markup. I use a little bit of tailwind to enhance our Tree View.

```svelte
<TreeView tree_data={tree_data} let:item>
    <div class="flex w-full group border-b border-b-blue-700 py-2">
        {#if item.children}
            <div class="grow">
                üìÅ {item.name}
            </div>
        {:else}
            <div class="grow">
                üìù {item.name}
            </div>
        {/if}
    </div>
</TreeView>
```

### Editable Tree View

Lastly, we can also make our Tree View editable. We must use the list and id slot props we pass to do this. Below you see some rather complex code with buttons for each element.

```svelte
<TreeView {tree_data} let:item={item} let:list={list} let:id={id}>
    <div class="flex w-full group border-b border-b-green-900 py-2">
        <div class="grow flex gap-2">
        {#if item.children && item.children.length > 0}
            üìÅ <div class="text-neutral-500">{ item.children.length }</div>
        {:else}
            üìÑ
        {/if}
        <input
            type= "text"
            value={item.name}
            class="grow shrink w-full bg-transparent px-1 focus:outline-none focus:ring-0"
            style="width: fit-content;"
            on:input={(ev) => { renameItem(list, id, ev.target.value) }}>
        <div class="flex rounded-md overflow-hidden text-xs bg-neutral-900 opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-all border border-neutral-700 text-neutral-500">
            <button on:click={() => { addItem(list, id) }} class="transition-all hover:text-green-100/50 hover:bg-green-800/50 px-2 py-1">Add File</button>
            <button on:click={() => { duplicateItem(list, id) }} class="transition-all hover:text-blue-100/50 hover:bg-blue-800/50 px-2 py-1">Duplicate</button>
            <button on:click={() => { deleteItem(list, id) }} class="transition-all hover:text-red-100/50 hover:bg-red-800/50 px-2 py-1">Delete</button>
        </div>
    </div>
</TreeView>
```

The Callback functions for these buttons look like this. They work with the list and id to change something about our data, and we always remember to trigger a reaction by assigning the tree data to itself because Svelte does not recognize function changes.

```js
function duplicateItem(list: any[], id: number) {
    list.splice(id + 1, 0, JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(list[id])));

    tree_data = tree_data;
}

function deleteItem(list: any[], id: number) {
    list.splice(id, 1);

    tree_data = tree_data;
}
```
