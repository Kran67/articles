About one year ago I got myself a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/). At first I did not really know what to do with it and then I bought a [camera](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/accessories/camera.html). I searched what to do with a Raspberry Pi and a camera and then I came across a Tuturial on how to create Timelapses. Thats exactly what I did but I added a few more complex aspects to it. My Program automatically captures a Timelapse at sunrise and stops and sunset, it will then upload the video to my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@MaximMaeder) and add it to a [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLisDN5bXPVdu14460SBv9iQVwklHINm6A).

I will sometimes abbreviate Raspberry Pi with RPi or just Pi.

# Physical Prerequisites

Before we can get to programing we actually have to get a few real life objects in order for this to work.

* [Raspberry PI](https://www.raspberrypi.com/)
* [Camera](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/accessories/camera.html#about-the-camera-modules)
* Tripod, to be flexible in placing it wherever you want
* Monitor, to connect to your Raspberry Pi
* Mouse and keyboard, to interact with the GUI on your RPi, of course a mouse is optional if your crazy about [shortcuts](https://maximmaeder.com/keyboard-shortcuts/).

Don't forget to consult the ["Getting started"](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html) guide on the official website. I won't go into setting up a Raspberry Pi.

# Capturing a Timelapse using Python

## Simple

## Taking the length of the day into account
Going on youtube you notice that the videos dont have the same length.

# Uploading the Timelapse Videos to Youtube

## Adding it to a youtube playlist

# Conclusion
