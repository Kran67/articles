description: A bunch of Tips and Tricks for the Open Source Game Engine Godot.
---

Recently I programmed a [Planet/Gravity Simulator](https://maximino.itch.io/planet-simulator) and now I want to share my thought on the process and the things I learned on the way. I will also share some [tips and tricks](https://maximmaeder.com/godot-tips-and-tricks/) I learned while working with the Godot Game Engine.


## Gravity Simulation

- [Formula](https://maximmaeder.com/calculating-gravity/)
- Simulation Speed 
  - Linear and Non Linear


## User Interface

- User Interface Singleton
- V-Split Container and reversing the order of the children
  - How does the VSPLIT in the Editor itself work?
- Themeing
  - Images for Checkboxes?
- Keyboard Shortcuts for Buttons and Menus
- Making a menu button conditionally disabled
