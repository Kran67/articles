The best way to learn is to do and thats why today I want to inspire you by presenting Ideas for programming projects that you could work on in your free time. This

Further more I will provide you with starting points for some of the projects by linking to other articles by me that describe these projects.

So lets get right into it!

## Recreating Famous Software or Famous UI Elements

Finding project ideas is not easy but you can get inspired by already existing software, sometimes I think to myself: *"wow this is cool but how was it made?"*. Lets go over some inspirations.

- Visual Studio Code (Or any Code Editor): You could try recreate [syntax highlighting](https://maximmaeder.com/highlighted-dummy-code-editor-with-html-css-javascript-vue-js/).
- Microsoft Word: Word is a *What you see is what you get* (WYSIWYG) Editor and it is based on HTML and CSS. Recreating something like this will be hard but rewarding in the end.
- Microsoft Excl: You could once again use your knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create your own [table calculation program](https://maximmaeder.com/simple-spreadsheet-app-with-vue/).
- Splash/Wave Button: [Google's Material Design](https://design.google/library/designing-material/) is probably most well known for its [special buttons](https://maximmaeder.com/ripple-button-with-html-sass-and-javascript/) that have this wave effect.
- Quizzes: There are many quiz apps out there like Kahoot or Quizlet and you can just as easily [create you own quiz](https://maximmaeder.com/country-quiz-with-html-sass-and-javascript/) about any topic you find interesting or you can utilize a [trivia api](https://the-trivia-api.com/).
- Explorer: If you know python you can use tkinter to make your very own file explorer.
- OBS: OBS is useful when you want record what you do on your computer. And you can recreate this program with JavaScript since there is an API for [Capturing Screens](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Screen_Capture_API/Using_Screen_Capture).
- Paint: Is the Default drawing program on windows and It is not really useful but it would be fun to recreate it so you could dive into the [canvas API  of JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas) or use the [graphics Library Pygame in Python](https://www.thepythoncode.com/article/make-a-drawing-program-with-python).
- Calculator: This one is pretty straight forward and probably also really easy so you could add some advanced features to [your calculator](https://maximmaeder.com/calculator-with-history-function-in-html-css-and-javascript/).

Now also for some honorable mentions.

[Tabs](https://maximmaeder.com/tabs-with-html-sass-and-js/), [Accordions](https://maximmaeder.com/accordion-with-html-css-sass-and-javascript/), [Dropdowns](https://maximmaeder.com/dropdown-with-sass-css/), [Sortable Tables](https://maximmaeder.com/sortable-table-with-javascript/), etc.

Essentially think of any UI Component.

## Making Games

*My Game [Tile Jumper 2088](https://maximino.itch.io/tile-jumper-2088).*

Making games today is easier than ever. There are some amazing tools out there that allow us to make awesome games with a small to no budget.

I myself really like the [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org/) and when it comes to graphics I boat well with [paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/) and Adobe Illustrator.

Game Jams often times have a topic that should serve as an inspiration and constraint that you can use to make a game in a short amount of time.

You could also use the *Physics Power* that these engines have to make simulations or other more test oriented software like a planet simulation.

Once Again you can also get inspiration from big AAA title or simply other games.

Lastly I don't know if it is just me but I think making games is really rewarding especially seeing your friends play your games (and fail ðŸ˜€).

## Make Notes of Things you Encounter

Lastly I want to give you a tip.

Every time you encounter something you think is interesting or noteworthy write it down! Make a list of all this things and store it in a safe location so you can every once in a while when you are bored look at your list of things and should have new ideas for what to program.

I myself have a Private Github where I store a Markdown document with all the things I want to make once or that I simply think are fascinating.
